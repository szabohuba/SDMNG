\section*{Abstract}


This thesis presents the conception and implementation of a real-time schedule management system, designed to assist users in tracking and organizing public transportation more effectively. The system takes the form of a dynamic web application that enables the management, display, and booking of information related to transit stops, routes, and timetables.

The document describes the core features of the application, the underlying data models, and the chosen technologiesâ€”including ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and the Leaflet library for interactive map rendering. It also discusses the key challenges faced throughout the development process and the solutions applied to overcome them.

The primary objective of the platform is to provide users with immediate and user-friendly access to transportation data, thereby improving the overall usability and efficiency of public transit systems.
